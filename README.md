### üïπÔ∏è The Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer [Gabriele Cirulli](https://gabrielecirulli.com). The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.


### üöÇ Motivation

I want to practice my programming skill using swift and  i love  the  game .So i got the motivation to remake the 2048 game using SwiftUI and Combine.

Here is a repository where i forked from, thanks for caiobzen's remarkable work.[2048-swiftui.](https://github.com/caiobzen/2048-swiftui)

After watching a series of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSn-DJU8qf0) on how to implement the 2048 game in JavaScript with P5, I got the inspiration to do the same with SwiftUI and Combine. So some of the logics behind matrices manipulation I borrowed from Mr. [Daniel Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman) *(Keep inspiring people with your videos )*.

You can find an article explaining the implementation here: [Medium](https://medium.com/@caiobzen/2048-swiftui-dda67949beb).

### üíª Requirements
- iOS 13+
- XCode 11.0+

### ü§ì How to run
Since this project has zero dependencies on external frameworks, all you need is:
- `‚åò + R` *(and that's it)*

### ‚òëÔ∏è Todo
1. Status (time played, average score, etc)

2. UNDO Button(A way to UNDO an action)

3. Work on the animations (shifting tiles, combining tiles, etc)
